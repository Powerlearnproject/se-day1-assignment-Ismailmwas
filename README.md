# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles,methods, and tools to develop and maintainance of software system.
its impontance: enable the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspectsof modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
2. the advert so structured programming in the 1970s
3. the rise af agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirements: gatherng and documenting user needs and systems
2. Design: creating high-level and detailed designs of the softaware architecture and user interface
3. Implementatins: writing a code and building the software according to the dsign specifications.
4. Testing: conducting tests to ensure software meets quality standards.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to user or customers.
6. Maintenence: providing on going support, updates and enhancements to the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
water fall methodologies is sequential approch with distict phases while Agile is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexbility colaboration and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software develper- writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer- ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
project manager- oversees the planning execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides comprehesive tools for writing debugging and testing code eg visual studio
VCS are used for tracking changes to source code and codnating work among team members eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements- Starategies : Continuous learning.
tight deadline .. Give time enough for the developer.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing -Ensures that individual units of code are correct
Integration testing- Verifies that components interact correctly
System testing- Validates the entire system
Acceptance testing- Ensures that software meets user expectations and business requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs
importance of Prompt
1. improve user experience
2. efficiency AI system
3. improved AI model perfomance.
4. reduce bias
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
